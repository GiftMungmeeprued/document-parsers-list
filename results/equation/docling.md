## 2.2 Regge trajectories and anomalous dimensions

Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest twist families are 'double-twist' operators built from two scalars ϕ i . These can be grouped into O N ( ) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

Here ' . . . ' represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is primary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N →∞ , these operators become higher-spin conserved currents with scaling dimensions ∆ = J + d -2. At finite N , the higher-spin symmetries are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2 singlet current, which is the stress tensor [( ϕ ϕ i i ) s ] 2 = T µν . The leading anomalous dimensions are [71, 72]

Here and below, we use the notation that ρ stands for an O N ( ) representation that can be either ' s ', 'sym', or 'asym'. The equation of motion implies that □ ϕ ∼ σϕ . Thus, [ σ ϕ ϕ ( i j ) ρ J ] plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for ϕ . Each additional insertion of σ or ϕ generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infiniteN limit, the theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in τ at large τ (for generic d ).

## 2.3 A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin J . Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer J become light-transforms of local operators L [ O ] (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen to be ∆ -d 2 and J , where (∆ , J ) = (1 -J L , 1 -∆ ), where (∆ L L , J L ) are the quantum numbers
