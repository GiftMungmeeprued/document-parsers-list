Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest twist families are “double-twist” operators built from two scalars ϕi. These can be grouped into O(N) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

| \[(ϕiϕj)s]J ∼ ϕi∂μ₁ · · · ∂μJ ϕi + · · ·       | τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| \[(ϕiϕj)sym]J ∼ ϕ(i∂μ₁ · · · ∂μJ ϕj) + · · ·   | τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) |
| \[(ϕiϕj)asym]J ∼ ϕ\[i∂μ₁ · · · ∂μJ ϕj] + · · · | τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) |

Here “. . . ” represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is primary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N → ∞, these operators become higher-spin conserved currents with scaling dimensions ∆ = J + d − 2. At finite N, the higher-spin symmetries are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2 singlet current, which is the stress tensor [(ϕiϕi)s]2 = Tμν. The leading anomalous dimensions are [71, 72]

| γsym,J = γasym,J = | 1 | 16(J − 1)(d + J − 2) sin πd Γ(d − 2) | d2                     | π(d + 2J − 4)(d + 2J − 2)Γ ~~2~~ − 2 Γ ~~2~~ + 1 |
| ------------------ | - | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| γs,J = γ(a)sym,J − | 1 | 8 sin πd Γ(d − 2)Γ(d + 1)Γ(J + 1)    | N π(d − 1)(d + 2J − 2) | 4)(d + 2J − 2)Γ ~~2~~ ~~2~~                      |

Some example higher-twist families are

| \[σϕi]J ∼ σ∂μ · · · ∂μϕi              | τ = d + 2 + O(1/N) |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| \[σ(ϕiϕj)ρ]J ∼ σ(ϕi∂μ₁ · · · ∂μJ ϕi)ρ | τ = d + O(1/N)     |
| \[σσ]J ∼ σ∂μ₁ · · · ∂μJ σ             | τ = 4 + O(1/N)     |

Here and below, we use the notation that ρ stands for an O(N) representation that can be either “s”, “sym”, or “asym”. The equation of motion implies that □ϕ ∼ σϕ. Thus, [σ(ϕiϕj)ρ]J plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for ϕ. Each additional insertion of σ or ϕ generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infinite-N limit, the theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in τ at large τ (for generic d).

# 2.3 A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin J. Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer J become light-transforms of local operators L[O] (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen to be ∆ − d and J, where (∆, J) = (1− JL, 1 − ∆L), where (∆L, JL) are the quantum numbers.
