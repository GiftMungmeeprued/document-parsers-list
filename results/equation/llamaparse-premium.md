Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest twist families are "double-twist" operators built from two scalars φ^i. These can be grouped into O(N) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

$$[(φ^iφ^j)_s]_J \sim φ^i∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}φ^i + · · · ,$$ $$τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) ,$$
$$[(φ^iφ^j)_{sym}]_J \sim φ^{(i}∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}φ^{j)} + · · · ,$$ $$τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) ,$$
$$[(φ^iφ^j)_{asym}]_J \sim φ^{[i}∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}φ^{j]} + · · · ,$$ $$τ = d − 2 + O(1/N) .$$ (2.5)

Here "..." represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is primary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N → ∞, these operators become higher-spin conserved currents with scaling dimensions Δ = J + d − 2. At finite N, the higher-spin symmetries are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2 singlet current, which is the stress tensor [(φ^iφ^i)_s]_2 = T_{μν}. The leading anomalous dimensions are [71, 72]

$$\gamma_{sym,J} = \gamma_{asym,J} = \frac{1}{N} \frac{16(J − 1)(d + J − 2) \sin (\frac{\pi d}{2}) \Gamma(d − 2)}{\pi(d + 2J − 4)(d + 2J − 2)\Gamma (\frac{d}{2} − 2) \Gamma (\frac{d}{2} + 1)} ,$$

$$\gamma_{s,J} = \gamma_{(a)sym,J} − \frac{1}{N} \frac{8\sin (\frac{\pi d}{2}) \Gamma(d − 2)\Gamma(d + 1)\Gamma(J + 1)}{\pi(d − 1)(d + 2J − 4)(d + 2J − 2)\Gamma (\frac{d}{2} − 2) \Gamma (\frac{d}{2} + 1) \Gamma(d + J − 3)} .$$
(2.6)

Some example higher-twist families are

$$[σφ^i]_J \sim σ∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}φ^i ,$$ $$τ = \frac{d+2}{2} + O(1/N) ,$$
$$[σ(φ^iφ^j)_ρ]_J \sim σ(φ^i∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}φ^i)_ρ ,$$ $$τ = d + O(1/N) ,$$
$$[σσ]_J \sim σ∂_{μ_1} · · · ∂_{μ_J}σ ,$$ $$τ = 4 + O(1/N) .$$ (2.7)

Here and below, we use the notation that ρ stands for an O(N) representation that can be either "s", "sym", or "asym". The equation of motion implies that □φ ∼ σφ. Thus, [σ(φ^iφ^j)_ρ]_J plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for φ. Each additional insertion of σ or φ generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infinite-N limit, the theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in τ at large τ (for generic d).

## 2.3 A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin J. Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer J become light-transforms of local operators L[O] (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen to be Δ − d/2 and J, where (Δ, J) = (1 − J_L, 1 − Δ_L), where (Δ_L, J_L) are the quantum numbers
