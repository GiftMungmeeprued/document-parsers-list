2.2 Regge trajectories and anomalous dimensions

Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest
twist families are “double-twist” operators built from two scalars ϕi. These can be grouped
into O(N ) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

[(ϕiϕj)s]J ∼ ϕi∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ ϕi + · · · ,
[(ϕiϕj)sym]J ∼ ϕ(i∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ ϕj) + · · · ,
[(ϕiϕj)asym]J ∼ ϕ[i∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ ϕj] + · · · ,

τ = d − 2 + O(1/N ) ,

τ = d − 2 + O(1/N ) ,

τ = d − 2 + O(1/N ) .

Here “. . . ” represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is pri-
mary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as
DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N → ∞, these operators become higher-spin conserved
currents with scaling dimensions ∆ = J + d − 2. At finite N , the higher-spin symmetries
are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2
singlet current, which is the stress tensor [(ϕiϕi)s]2 = Tµν. The leading anomalous dimensions
are [71, 72]

Some example higher-twist families are

[σϕi]J ∼ σ∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ ϕi ,
[σ(ϕiϕj)ρ]J ∼ σ(ϕi∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ ϕi)ρ ,
[σσ]J ∼ σ∂µ1 · · · ∂µJ σ ,

τ = d+2

2 + O(1/N ) ,

τ = d + O(1/N ) ,

τ = 4 + O(1/N ) .

(2.7)

Here and below, we use the notation that ρ stands for an O(N ) representation that can
be either “s”, “sym”, or “asym”. The equation of motion implies that □ϕ ∼ σϕ. Thus,
[σ(ϕiϕj)ρ]J plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for ϕ. Each additional insertion
of σ or ϕ generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infinite-N limit, the
theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in τ at large τ (for generic d).

2.3 A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin J.
Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer J become light-transforms of local
operators L[O] (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a
Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen
to be ∆− d
2 and J, where (∆, J) = (1−JL, 1−∆L), where (∆L, JL) are the quantum numbers
