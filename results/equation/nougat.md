Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest twist families are "double-twist" operators built from two scalars \(\phi^{i}\). These can be grouped into \(O(N)\) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

\[[(\phi^{i}\phi^{j})_{s}]_{J}\sim\phi^{i}\partial_{\mu_{1}}\cdots \partial_{\mu_{J}}\phi^{i}+\cdots\,, \tau =d-2+O(1/N)\,,\] \[[(\phi^{i}\phi^{j})_{\rm sym}]_{J}\sim\phi^{(i}\partial_{\mu_{1}} \cdots\partial_{\mu_{J}}\phi^{j})+\cdots\,, \tau =d-2+O(1/N)\,,\] \[[(\phi^{i}\phi^{j})_{\rm asym}]_{J}\sim\phi^{[i}\partial_{\mu_{1}} \cdots\partial_{\mu_{J}}\phi^{j]}+\cdots\,, \tau =d-2+O(1/N)\,. \tag{5}\]

Here "\(\ldots\)" represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is primary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit \(N\to\infty\), these operators become higher-spin conserved currents with scaling dimensions \(\Delta=J+d-2\). At finite \(N\), the higher-spin symmetries are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2 singlet current, which is the stress tensor \([(\phi^{i}\phi^{i})_{s}]_{2}=T_{\mu\nu}\). The leading anomalous dimensions are [71, 72]

\[\gamma_{\rm sym,J}=\gamma_{\rm asym,J}=\frac{1}{N}\frac{16(J-1)(d +J-2)\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{2}\right)\Gamma(d-2)}{\pi(d+2J-4)(d+2J-2)\Gamma \left(\frac{d}{2}-2\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{d}{2}+1\right)}\,,\] \[\gamma_{s,J}=\gamma_{\rm(a)sym,J}-\frac{1}{N}\frac{8\sin\left( \frac{\pi d}{2}\right)\Gamma(d-2)\Gamma(d+1)\Gamma(J+1)}{\pi(d-1)(d+2J-4)(d+2 J-2)\Gamma\left(\frac{d}{2}-2\right)\Gamma\left(\frac{d}{2}+1\right)\Gamma(d+J-3)}\,. \tag{6}\]

Some example higher-twist families are

\[[\sigma\phi^{i}]_{J}\sim\sigma\partial_{\mu_{1}}\cdots\partial_{ \mu_{J}}\phi^{i}\,, \tau =\frac{d+2}{2}+O(1/N)\,,\] \[[\sigma(\phi^{i}\phi^{j})_{\rho}]_{J}\sim\sigma(\phi^{i}\partial _{\mu_{1}}\cdots\partial_{\mu_{J}}\phi^{i})_{\rho}\,, \tau =d+O(1/N)\,,\] \[[\sigma\sigma]_{J}\sim\sigma\partial_{\mu_{1}}\cdots\partial_{\mu _{J}}\sigma\,, \tau =4+O(1/N)\,. \tag{7}\]

Here and below, we use the notation that \(\rho\) stands for an \(O(N)\) representation that can be either "\(s\)", "\(\rm sym\)", or "\(\rm asym\)". The equation of motion implies that \(\Box\phi\sim\sigma\phi\). Thus, \([\sigma(\phi^{i}\phi^{j})_{\rho}]_{J}\) plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for \(\phi\). Each additional insertion of \(\sigma\) or \(\phi\) generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infinite-\(N\) limit, the theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in \(\tau\) at large \(\tau\) (for generic \(d\)).

### A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin \(J\). Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer \(J\) become light-transforms of local operators \({\bf L}[{\cal O}]\) (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen to be \(\Delta-\frac{d}{2}\) and \(J\), where \((\Delta,J)=(1-J_{L},1-\Delta_{L})\), where \((\Delta_{L},J_{L})\) are the quantum numbers
