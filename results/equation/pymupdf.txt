Regge trajectories and anomalous dimensions
Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest
twist families are “double-twist” operators built from two scalars ϕi. These can be grouped
into O(N) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:
[(ϕiϕj)s]J ∼ϕi∂µ1 · · · ∂µJϕi + · · · ,
τ = d −2 + O(1/N) ,
[(ϕiϕj)sym]J ∼ϕ(i∂µ1 · · · ∂µJϕj) + · · · ,
τ = d −2 + O(1/N) ,
[(ϕiϕj)asym]J ∼ϕ[i∂µ1 · · · ∂µJϕj] + · · · ,
τ = d −2 + O(1/N) .

Here “. . . ” represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is pri-
mary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as
DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N →∞, these operators become higher-spin conserved
currents with scaling dimensions ∆= J + d −2. At finite N, the higher-spin symmetries
are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2
singlet current, which is the stress tensor [(ϕiϕi)s]2 = Tµν. The leading anomalous dimensions
are [71, 72]
