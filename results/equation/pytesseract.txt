2.2 Regge trajectories and anomalous dimensions

Let us list some families of local operators that will be important in this work. The lowest
twist families are “double-twist” operators built from two scalars ¢’. These can be grouped

into O(N) singlets, antisymmetric tensors, and symmetric tensors as follows:

[(¢'") sly ~ b'On, a One tee, T=d—-2+ O(1/N) ’
[(6° 9 )syml a ~ Opn + gO? +o 5 7 =d-2+0(1/N),
[(¢'# Jasyml J ~ by, ue Oy, 1 tees, T=d—-2+ O(1/N) : (2.5)

Here “...” represents combinations of derivatives needed to ensure that the operator is pri-

mary. By analogy with QCD, we will sometimes refer to these leading twist operators as

 

DGLAP-type [2, 69, 70]. In the limit N — oo, these operators become higher-spin conserved
currents with scaling dimensions A = J +d-— 2. At finite N, the higher-spin symmetries
are slightly broken and these operators acquire anomalous dimensions, except for the spin-2
singlet current, which is the stress tensor ((¢'¢")s]2 = Tw. The leading anomalous dimensions
are [71, 72]

Some example higher-twist families are

[o6']y ~ Ou, ps9 r= 5? +O(1/N),

[o(9'd )ola ~ o(6'On, - Ons") p ; T=d+O(1/N),

[oo] ys ~ Gp, ++ Ops, 7r=4+0(1/N). (2.7)

 

Here and below, we use the notation that p stands for an O(N) representation that can

 

bg?
,

be either “s”, “sym”, or “asym”. The equation of motion implies that Od ~ ad. Thus,

 

 

[o(¢'d) | plays the role of a subleading double-twist family for ¢. Each additional insertion

 

of o or ¢ generates additional subleading trajectories. Thus, even in the infinite-N limit, the
theory contains a rich set of families that become dense in 7 at large 7 (for generic d).

2.3 A first look at the Chew-Frautschi plot

A Regge trajectory is a family of light-ray operators depending continuously on spin J.
Nonvanishing light-ray operators with nonnegative integer J become light-transforms of local
operators L[{O] (or their shadow transforms). We can visualize Regge trajectories using a
Chew-Frautschi plot. The coordinates of the Chew-Frautschi plot are conventionally chosen
to be A— $ and J, where (A, J) = (1—Jz,1—Arz), where (Az, Jz) are the quantum numbers
