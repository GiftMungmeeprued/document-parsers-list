During the later periods, this system evolved to include the classical arts of music (sangita), dance (nritya), drama (n훮tya) and literature (s훮hitya). To ensure holistic and all-round development of the students, administration and warfare was also taught, to build up on their core values. Gradually, this age-old tradition led to the growth of a new class of Indians (or Sam훮tanis) who were immortalized as enlightened philosophers, unconquerable emperors, extraordinary performers, and unforgettable writers. Thus, they emerged as masters of their craft, further spreading their own knowledge to younger ones, keeping the parampar훮 alive.

Take, for instance, the various names from history. Chandragupta Maurya, heralded as one of the greatest emperors in Indian history, was guided by his guru, Chamakya. Jansen and Baiju Bawra, men whose names have been sealed in the topmost tier of music, were ardent followers of Swami Haridas. Coming to spirituality, poets and writers such as Mirabai and Kabirdas were students of Guru Ravidas and Guru Ramanand respectively. Even in contemporary times, we see before us the divine bond between Swami Vivekananda and his guru - Shri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa.
