Humor. Sometimes you have to laugh literally. Keep yourself from crying and when you do, it can make you more resilient. Humor helps you release stress and itâ€™s a conduit to strengthening social bonds while being protective against stress. A study of sojourn students from mainland China attending school at a Hong Kong university, for instance, found that the students who used humor to adjust to the new culture were able to thrive best and that humor acted as a buffer against stress.

Humor and laughter are wonderful resources when coping with hardship, because they lighten the load emotionally as well as physiologically. Laughter can especially relax the stress response, give you more energy, and soothe tension. It has also been found that laughter can improve your immune system, relieve pain, improve your mood, and enhance a sense of well being. You always have the option to make use of your funny bone during times of stress. Credit (Resilience for Dummies) Published by Eva Selhub, MD.
