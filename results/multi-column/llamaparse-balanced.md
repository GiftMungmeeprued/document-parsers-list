To minimize the risk of fire or store the appliance where it will not be exposed to sub-zero temperatures or exposed to the weather. Fit the power plug to a grounded wall socket that complies with all statutory regulations and ordinances. Ensure that the base opening is free from obstruction by carpeting if the washing machine is installed on a carpeted floor. In countries where there is a risk of cockroach infestation or other vermin, pay particular attention to keep the appliance and its surroundings in a clean condition at all times.

Warning: Before cleaning the washing machine interior, unplug the electrical power cord to avoid the risk of electric shock. Read all instructions and explanations of the installation before use. Follow the instructions carefully. Keep the operating instructions handy for later use. If the appliance is sold or passed on then ensure that the new owner always receives these operating instructions. The following warnings must be strictly observed for safety reasons. They must be read before installing the appliance and putting it into operation.

# Cleaning the water inlet filter

• Water supply is not adequate in area: Check another tap in the house.

• Water supply taps are not completely open: Fully open tap.

• Water inlet hose(s) are kinked: Straighten hose(s).

• The filter of the inlet hose(s) are clogged: Check the filter of the inlet hose(s).

# Cleaning the drain pump filter

• The drain filter is clogged: Clean the drain filter.

• Load is too small: Add 1 or 2 similar items to help balance the load.

• Load is out of balance: Rearrange load to allow proper spinning.

• The appliance has an unbalance detection and correction system. If individual heavy articles are loaded (ex. bath mat, robe, etc.), this system may stop spinning or even interrupt the spin cycle altogether.

# CAUTION about positioning the appliance

• The washing machine must not be installed in rooms where the temperature may drop below 0°C.

• Never try to correct any unevenness in the floor using pieces of wood, cardboard or similar materials under the washing machine.

• If the appliance is placed on a carpet then place the feet so that air can circulate underneath the appliance.

# CAUTION about the power cord

We recommend connecting most appliances to a dedicated circuit which is protected by a mains fuse. That is, a single outlet supplying power only to the appliance concerned, without any additional outlets or branch circuits. Check the specifications of this owner‘s manual. Do not overload wall sockets. Overloaded wall sockets, loose or damaged wall sockets or extension cords, frayed power cords, damaged or cracked wire insulation are dangerous. Any of these conditions could result in electric shock or fire.

# Electrical connection

This appliance must be earthed. As the colours of the wires in the mains lead of this apparatus may not correspond with the coloured markings identifying the terminals in your plug, proceed as follows: The green and yellow wire must be connected to the terminal marked E or by the earth symbol or coloured green or green and yellow. The wire coloured blue must be connected to the terminal marked with the letter N or coloured black. The wire coloured brown must be connected to the terminal marked with the letter L or coloured red. If a 13 amp (BS 1363) plug is used, fit a 13 amp BS 1362 fuse.

# Cleaning the dispenser drawer

Once you have finished cleaning, replace the drawer and run a rinse cycle without laundry or soap.

# Proper care of your washing machine can extend its service life.

The outside of the machine can be cleaned with warm water and a neutral non-abrasive household detergent. Immediately wipe off any spillage. Wipe with damp cloth. Avoid striking the surface with sharp objects. Never hose down the machine!
