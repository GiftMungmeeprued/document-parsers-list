## Installation of drain hose

## Level adjustment

![](_page_0_Picture_7.jpeg)

- Proper level-adjustment of the washing machine prevents excessive noise and vibration. Install the appliance on a solid and level fl oor surface, preferably in a corner of the room.
- If the fl oor is uneven, adjust feet as required. (Do not insert pieces of wood etc. under the feet). Make sure that all four feet are stable and resting on the fl oor. Then check that the appliance is perfectly level. (Use a spirit level).

- Wooden fl oors are particularly susceptible to vibration.
- To prevent vibration we recommend you place rubber cups under each foot, at least 15mm thick under the washer, secured to at least 2 fl oor beams with screws. Rubber Cup
- If possible install the washer in one of the corners of the room, where the fl oor is more stable.

Insert the rubber cups to reduce vibration.

You can obtain the rubber cups (p/no.4620ER4002B) from the LG spares dept.

## Wooden fl oors (Suspended fl oors)

- The drain hose should not be placed higher than 100 cm above the fl oor.
- Proper securing of the drain hose will protect the fl oor from damage due to any water leakage.
- If the drain hose is too long do not force back into the washing machine. This will cause abnormal noise and cause the machine to malfunction and leak.

# Safety instructions for use Safety instuctions for the installation

### Troubleshooting

Install or store the appliance where it will not be exposed to sub-zero temperatures or exposed to the weather. Fit the power plug to a grounded wall socket that complies with all statutory regulations and ordinances. Ensure that the base opening is free from obstruction by carpeting if the washing machine is installed on a carpeted fl oor. In countries where there is a risk of cockroach infestation or other vermin, pay particular attention to keep the appliance and its surroundings in a clean condition at all times. Any damage which may be caused by cockroaches or other vermin is not covered by the appliance guarantee.

### **CAUTION about positioning the appliance**

### **Install the washing machine on a fl at hard fl oor. Make sure that air circulation around the washing machine is not impeded by carpets, rug etc.**

• Never try to correct any unevenness in the fl oor using pieces of wood, cardboard or similar materials under the washing machine. • If it is not possible to position the washing machine away from a gas cooker or coal burning stove, an insulation panel (85x60cm) covered with aluminum foil on the side facing the cooker or stove, must be inserted between the two appliances.

- 
- 
- The washing machine must not be installed in rooms where the temperature may drop below 0°C.
- Please ensure that when the washing machine is installed , that a Service Technician can gain easy access in the event of a
- breakdown. the top of the washing machine and underside of the worktop.

• Adjust all four feet using the transit bolt spanner provided to ensure that the appliance is stable, with 20mm clearnace between

### **CAUTION about the power cord**

We recommend connecting most appliances to a dedicated circuit which is protected by a mains fuse. That is, a single outlet supplying power only to the appliance concerned, without any additional outlets or branch circuits. Check the specifi cations of this owner's manual. Do not overload wall sockets. Overloaded wall sockets, loose or damaged wall sockets or extension cords, frayed power cords, damaged or cracked wire insulation are dangerous. Any of these conditions could result in electric shock or fi re. Periodically examine the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or deterioration, unplug it, discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord replaced with an exact replacement part by an authorized servicer. Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted, kinked, pinched, squashed in a jamb of a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs, wall outlets, and the point where the cord exits the appliance.

### **CAUTION about location and moving**

This equipment is not designed for maritime use or for use mobile installations such as caravans, aircraft etc. Turn off the stopcock if the machine is to be left for any length of time (e.g. if you are going on holiday), especially if there is no fl oor drain (gully) in the immediate vicinity. If relocating the appliance use the original packing material. Packaging material (e.g. plastic fi lm, Styrofoam) can be dangerous for children. There is a risk of suffocation! Keep all packaging well away from children and do not allow children to play inside the bowl as they may become trapped.

### **CAUTION about the fl oor surface**

• Install washing machine on a fl at hard fl oor. Poorly constructed timber base fl oors can contribute to excessive noise and

- The installation surface must be clean, dry and level.
- vibration.
- Proper placement and levelling of the washing machine ensure long, regular and reliable operation.
- The washing machine must be perfectly level and fi rmly in position.
- It must not "see-saw" across corners under load.
- The installation surface must be clean, free from fl oor wax and other lubricant coatings.
- Do not allow the feet of the washing machine to get wet. If feet of the washing machine get wet, slipping may occur.

## Safety instructions for use

### **To minimize the risk of fi re within the inner bowl, the following should be observed:**

• Items that have been spotted or soaked with vegetable or cooking oil constitute a fi re hazard and should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Oil-affected items can ignite spontaneously, especially when exposed to heat sources Such as in a tumble dryer. The items become warm, causing an oxidation reaction in the oil. Oxidation creates heat. If the heat cannot escape, the items can become hot enough to catch fi re. Piling, stacking or storing oil-affected items can prevent heat from escaping and so create a fi re hazard. If it is unavoidable that fabrics that contain vegetable or cooking oil or have been contaminated by hair care products be placed in a tumble dryer they should fi rst be washed in hot water with extra detergent-this will reduce, but not eliminate, the hazard. The 'cool down' cycle of tumble dryers should be used to reduce the temperature of the items. They should not be removed from the tumble dryer or piled or stacked while hot.

• Items that have been previously cleaned in, washed in, soaked in or spotted with petrol/gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents or other fl ammable or explosive substances should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Highly fl ammable substances commonly used in domestic environments include acetone, denatured alcohol, petrol/gasoline, kerosene, spot removers (some brands), turpentine, waxes and wax removers.

- 
- 
- Items containing foam rubber (also known as latex foam) or similarly testured rubber like materials should not be dried in a tumble dryer on a heat setting. Foam rubber materials can, when heated, produce fi re by spontaneous combustion.
- Fabric softeners or similar products should not be used during a drying cycle, to eliminate the effects of static electricity unless this practice is specifi cally recommended by the manufacturer of the fabric softener or product.
- 
- 
- a tumble dryer.

- Undergarments that contain metal reinforcements should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Damage to the tumble dryer can result if metal reinforcements come loose during drying. When available a drying rack could be used for such items.
- Plastic articles such as shower caps or babies waterproof napkin covers should not be placed in a tumble dryer.
- Rubber-backed articles, clothes fi tted with foam rubber pads, pillows, rubber boots and rubber-coated tennis shoes should not be placed in
