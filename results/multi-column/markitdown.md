Make sure that all four feet are stable and resting on the ﬂ oor.
Then check that the appliance is perfectly level.
(Use a spirit level).

Cleaning in general

Important: Do not use methylated spirits, solvents or similar products.

Exterior
Proper care of your washing machine can extend its service life.
The outside of the machine can be cleaned with warm water and
a neutral non-abrasive household detergent. Immediately wipe off
any spillage. Wipe with damp cloth. Avoid striking the surface with
sharp objects. Never hose down the machine!

Interior
Dry around the washing machine door
opening, flexible gasket and door
glass. Run washing machine through a
complete cycle using hot water. Repeat
process if necessary.

Wooden ﬂ oors (Suspended ﬂ oors)
• Wooden ﬂ oors are particularly susceptible to vibration.
•  To prevent vibration we recommend you place rubber cups under each foot,

at least 15mm thick under the washer, secured to at least 2 ﬂ oor beams with screws.

Rubber Cup

•  If possible install the washer in one of the corners of the room, where the ﬂ oor

is more stable.

   Insert the rubber cups to reduce vibration.
   You can obtain the rubber cups (p/no.4620ER4002B)  from the LG spares dept.

Safety instructions for use

Safety instructions for use

To minimize the risk of ﬁ re within the inner bowl, the following should be observed:
•  Items that have been spotted or soaked with vegetable or cooking oil constitute a ﬁ re hazard and should not be placed in a tumble dryer.

Oil-affected items can ignite spontaneously, especially when exposed to heat sources Such as in a tumble dryer. The items become warm,
causing an oxidation reaction in the oil. Oxidation creates heat. If the heat cannot escape, the items can become hot enough to catch ﬁ re.
Piling, stacking or storing oil-affected items  can prevent heat from escaping and so create a ﬁ re hazard. If it is unavoidable that fabrics that
contain vegetable or cooking oil or have been contaminated by hair care products be placed in a tumble dryer they should ﬁ rst be washed in
hot water with extra detergent-this will reduce, but not eliminate, the hazard. The ‘cool down’ cycle of tumble dryers should be used to reduce
the temperature of the items. They should not be removed from the tumble dryer or piled or stacked while hot.

•  Items that have been previously cleaned in, washed in, soaked in or spotted with petrol/gasoline, dry-cleaning solvents or other ﬂ ammable or
explosive substances should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Highly ﬂ ammable substances commonly used in domestic environments include
acetone, denatured alcohol, petrol/gasoline, kerosene, spot removers (some brands), turpentine, waxes and wax removers.

•  Items containing foam rubber (also known as latex foam) or similarly testured rubber like materials should not be dried in a tumble dryer on a

heat setting. Foam rubber materials can, when heated, produce ﬁ re by spontaneous combustion.

•  Fabric softeners or similar products should not be used during a drying cycle, to eliminate the effects of static electricity

unless this practice is speciﬁ cally recommended by the manufacturer of the fabric softener or product.

•  Undergarments that contain metal reinforcements should not be placed in a tumble dryer.  Damage to the tumble dryer can result if metal

reinforcements come loose during drying.  When available a drying rack could be used for such items.

• Plastic articles such as shower caps or babies waterproof napkin covers should not be placed in a tumble dryer.
•  Rubber-backed articles, clothes ﬁ tted with foam rubber pads, pillows, rubber boots and rubber-coated tennis shoes should not be placed in

a tumble dryer.

•   If  it  is  not  possible  to  position  the  washing  machine  away  from  a  gas  cooker  or  coal  burning  stove,  an  insulation  panel
(85x60cm) covered with aluminum foil on the side facing the cooker or stove, must be inserted between the two appliances.

•   The washing machine must not be installed in rooms where the temperature may drop below 0°C.
•   Please ensure that when the washing machine is installed , that a Service Technician can gain easy access in the event of a

breakdown.

•   Adjust all four feet using the transit bolt spanner provided to ensure that the appliance is stable, with 20mm clearnace between

the top of the washing machine and underside of the worktop.

CAUTION about the power cord
We recommend connecting most appliances to a dedicated circuit which is protected by a mains fuse. That is, a single outlet
supplying power only to the appliance concerned, without any additional outlets or branch circuits. Check the speciﬁ cations
of this owner‘s manual. Do not overload wall sockets. Overloaded wall sockets, loose or damaged wall sockets or extension
cords, frayed power cords, damaged or cracked wire insulation are dangerous. Any of these conditions could result in electric
shock or ﬁ re. Periodically examine the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or deterioration, unplug it,
discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord replaced with an exact replacement part by an authorized servicer. Protect
the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted, kinked, pinched, squashed in a jamb of a door, or
walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs, wall outlets, and the point where the cord exits the appliance.

CAUTION about location and moving
This  equipment  is  not  designed  for  maritime  use  or  for  use  mobile  installations  such  as  caravans,  aircraft  etc.  Turn  off  the
stopcock if the machine is to be left for any length of time (e.g. if you are going on holiday), especially if there is no ﬂ oor drain
(gully) in the immediate vicinity. If relocating the appliance use the original packing material. Packaging material (e.g. plastic ﬁ lm,
Styrofoam) can be dangerous for children. There is a risk of suffocation! Keep all packaging well away from children and do not
allow children to play inside the bowl as they may become trapped.

CAUTION about the ﬂ oor surface
•   The installation surface must be clean, dry and level.
•   Install washing machine on a ﬂ at hard ﬂ oor. Poorly constructed timber base ﬂ oors can contribute to excessive noise and

vibration.

•   Proper placement and levelling of the washing machine ensure long, regular and reliable operation.
•   The washing machine must be perfectly level and ﬁ rmly in position.
•   It must not “see-saw” across corners under load.
•   The installation surface must be clean, free from ﬂ oor wax and other lubricant coatings.
•   Do not allow the feet of the washing machine to get wet. If feet of the washing machine get wet, slipping may occur.
