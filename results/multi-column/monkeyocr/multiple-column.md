# Cleaning and Maintenance  

- Items that have been spotted or soaked with vegetable or cooking oil constitute a fire hazard and should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Oil-infested items can spontaneously ignite, especially when exposed to hot sources such as in a tumble dryer. The items become warm, causing an oxidation reaction in the oil. Oxidation creates heat. If the heat cannot escape, the items can become hot enough to catch fire. Fire, smoking or carbon monoxide poisoning can result if the item is not removed. Items that are made of materials that contain vegetable or cooking oil or have been contamination by hair care products be placed in a tumble dryer should first be washed in hot water with extra detergents this will reduce, but not eliminate, the hazard. The "cool down" cycle of tumble dryers should be used to reduce the temperature of the item before it is placed in the tumble dryer. Items that have been previously cleaned in, washed in, soiled or operated with petrol/gasoline, oil, dry cleaning solvents or other inflammatory or explosive substances should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Highly flammable substances commonly used in domestic environments include acetone, diisobutyl alcohol, petrol/gasoline, kerosene, spirit removers (some brands), turpentine, waxes and wax removers. Items containing metal objects should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Items containing metal objects should be placed in a tumble dryer on a hot setting. Foam rubber materials can, when heated, produce fire by spontaneous combustion. Fabric softeners or similar products should not be used during a drying cycle, to eliminate the effects of static electricity which often causes static discharges. Undergarments that contain metal reinforcement should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Damage to the tumble dryer can result if metal reinforcement becomes loose during drying. When available a drying rack could be used for such items. Plastic, rubber and rubberized items should not be placed in a tumble dryer. Rubber backed articles, clothes dried with rubber based pastes, rubber, rubberized rubber and rubber coated rubber articles should not be placed in a tumble dryer.  

Antrous objects such as holes or shallow pits impact in beams or beams. Never make cuts that produce a flapping island. This is usually normal. Bevel all contact pads and beveling must be removed. Track and lightening have consequences. Unbeveling pads. Contact planner if necessary. Do not disassemble parts or unsuitable surfaces.

Cleaning in general Important: Do not use methylated spirits, solvents or similar products.  

Extra care of your washing machine can extend its service life. The outside of the machine can be cleaned with warm water and a neutral non-abrasive household detergent. Immediately wipe off any fingerprints and use with damp cloth. Avoid etching the surface with sharp objects. Never leave down the machine.

Dry around the washing machine door opening, flexible gasket and door glass. Run washing machine through a complete cycle using hot water. Replaced filters if necessary.

- The drain hose should not be placed higher than 100 cm above the floor.
- Proper securing of the drain hose will protect the floor from damage due to any water leakage.
- If the drain hose is too long do not force back into the washing machine. This will cause abnormal noise and cause the machine to malfunction and leak.  

- Proper level adjustment of the washing machine prevents excessive noise and vibration. Install the appliance on a solid and level floor surface, preferably in a corner of the room.  

- If the floor is uneven, adjust feet as required. (Do not insert pieces of wood etc. under the feet). Make sure that all four feet are stable and resting on the floor. Then check that the appliance is perfectly level. (Use a spirit level).  

To minimize the risk of fire within the inner bowl, the following should be observed:  

# Electrical connection  

# BS Plug Safety Details (For U.K. User)  

# Wooden floors (Suspended floors)  

# Safety instructions for use Safety instructions for use  

This appliance must be earthed As the colours of the wires in the mains lead of this apparatus may not correspond with the coloured markings identifying the terminals in your plug, proceed as follows: The green and yellow wire must be connected to the terminal in your plug marked with the letter G or coloured green and yellow. The wire coloured blue must be connected to the terminal marked with the letter B or coloured black. The wire coloured brown must be connected to the terminal marked with the letter L or coloured red. If a 13 amp (BS 1362) plug is used, fit a 13 amp BS 1362 fuse.  

To prevent vibration we recommend you place 2 rubber cups under each foot, at least 15mm thick under the washer, secured to at least 2 floor beams with screws. If possible install the washer in one of the corners of the room, where the floor is more stable. Insert the rubber cups to reduce vibration. You can obtain the rubber cups (p/n A620E94008) from the LG spares shop!

# CAUTION about the power cord  

We recommend connecting most appliances to a dedicated circuit which is protected by a mains fuse. That is, a single outlet supplying power only to the appliance consumed, without any additional outlets or branch circuits. Check the specifications of this device for electrical equipment wall sockets. Overheated wall sockets, loose or damaged wiring or extension cords, tripped power cords, damaged or cracked wire insulation are dangerous. Any of these conditions could result in electric shock or fire. Periodically examine the cord of your appliance, and if its appearance indicates damage or deterioration, unplug it, discontinue use of the appliance, and have the cord repaired with an exact replacement part by an authorized technician. Protect the power cord from physical or mechanical abuse, such as being twisted, pinched, squashed in a jumble of a door, or walked upon. Pay particular attention to plugs, wall outlets, and the point where the conductors enter the appliance.  

ALGORITHM about location and $r$

Never try to open the door while the machine is in operation. The product should be serviced and repaired only by the authorised customer service using original replacement parts. When disposing of your old machine, the power cable must be capped and the door lock must be made unusable in order to protect children. Never place the machine on a wet or damp surface. If the appliance has been under water then contact the customer service. There is danger of electric shock and fire. The cover cup of the filter as well as the dispenser drawer may not be opened during the operation. Keep oil washing powder and detergents away from children. Danger of poisoning.  

This equipment is not designed for real-time use or for use mobile installations such as caravans, aircraft etc. Turn off the stopcock if the machine is to be left for any length of time (e.g. if you are going on holiday), especially if there is no floor drain (pulp) in the immediate vicinity. If reactivating the appliance use the original packing material. Packaging material (e.g. plastic film, Shearfert®) can be dangerous for children. There is a risk of suffocation! Keep all packaging well away from children and do not allow children to enter.莫 leave the product for three times between first use.
