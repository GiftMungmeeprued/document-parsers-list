• Proper securing of the drain hose will protect the fl oor from damage due to any water leakage.
• If the drain hose is too long do not force back into the washing machine. This will cause abnormal
noise and cause the machine to malfunction and leak. Level adjustment
• Proper level-adjustment of the washing machine prevents
excessive noise and vibration. Install the appliance on a solid
and level fl oor surface, preferably in a corner of the room.
• If the fl oor is uneven, adjust feet as required.
(Do not insert pieces of wood etc. under the feet).
Make sure that all four feet are stable and resting on the fl oor.
Then check that the appliance is perfectly level.
(Use a spirit level).
Wooden fl oors (Suspended fl oors)
• Wooden fl oors are particularly susceptible to vibration.
• To prevent vibration we recommend you place rubber cups under each foot,
at least 15mm thick under the washer, secured to at least 2 fl oor beams with screws. Rubber Cup
• If possible install the washer in one of the corners of the room, where the fl oor
is more stable.
Insert the rubber cups to reduce vibration. You can obtain the rubber cups (p/no.4620ER4002B) from the LG spares dept.
